# DayPlanner


This is a simple day planner that allows a user to plan out their day in hour blocks.

The app tracks the time and presents hour blocks as "past", "present", or "future".

If the user "saves" their entry, the app utilizes local storage and displays the data even if the page is refreshed or the app is closed.
